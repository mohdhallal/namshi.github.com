technologies are integrated every week to be able to keep up to date with the market and the technology around us.
That&rsquo;s how we started using nodejs, Angular, Docker, SPDY and much more&hellip;</p>

    <id>http://namshi.github.io/blog/2014/09/20/interested-in-the-history-of-nodejs-then-lets-hear-it-from-lucio-at-the-confoo</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not really hard to believe, NodeJS is a beloved one among
the plethora of technologies that we use at <a href="https://namshi.com">Namshi</a>;
that&rsquo;s why we got people like <a href="/team#Luciano%20Colosio">Lucio</a> on board so that we
could expand in that direction.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="left team" src="/images/lucio.jpg" title="Luciano Colosio" ></p>

<p>And you know what? Lucio loves Node so much that he&rsquo;d like
to talk about it at a big stage, like the one the
<a href="http://confoo.ca/">ConFoo</a> of next february.</p>

<p>Then don&rsquo;t miss the chance to
<a href="http://confoo.ca/en/call-for-papers/speaker/luciano-colosio">vote one of his proposals</a>
as he&rsquo;d be very happy to introduce you the history of NodeJS
(I heard part of that talk, since he already gave it internally
for the Namshi team, and I have to admit it was freaking
interesting), how it was born and what pushed
<a href="http://www.quora.com/Who-is-Ryan-Dahl">Rian Dahl</a> to write
this beautiful platform; the other talk that he has in the
pipeline is a good introduction on how to embrace the
non-blocking paradigm and he will explain how to make sure
that you treat the Event Loop responsibly :)</p>

<p>Definitely worth it!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/team#Geshan%20Manandhar">Geshan</a> has decided
he can&rsquo;t stand seeing people struggling with
crons anymore, therefore he decided to give it a
shot at the <a href="http://confoo.ca/en/call-for-papers/speaker/geshan-manandhar">2015 edition of the confoo</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="right team" src="/images/geshan.jpg"></p>

<p>If you want to hear how Symfony integrates (so) nicely
with messaging queues and, specifically, with RabbitMQ
don&rsquo;t waste a second and <a href="http://confoo.ca/en/call-for-papers/speaker/geshan-manandhar">vote his talk</a>
so that he can get the chance to take the stage at the
canadian conference.</p>

<p>He will talk about our <strong>direct experience with RabbitMQ</strong>,
including <strong>MQ best practices</strong> and an overview of the
available tools, so that the audience will be able to
understand the theory, see how it works in practice
and form his own opinion.</p>

<p>Well done Geshan, we hope to hear how Namshi handles
gazilions of messages in Canada!</p>

regarding <a href="/blog/2014/09/10/what-is-frontend-first-lets-hear-it-at-the-next-edition-of-the-confoo/">&ldquo;conquering&rdquo; the ConFoo</a>,
as promised, we go ahead with the second
charge!</p>

<p><img class="team right" src="/images/cirpo.jpg"></p>

<p><a href="/team">Cirpo</a> has decided to capitalize on
the opportunity of being in the cold lands of
Canada to offer <strong>a few</strong> learning opportunities
for the attendees, as
<a href="http://confoo.ca/en/call-for-papers/speaker/alessandro-cinelli">the list of his proposals</a>
is quite long and impressive.</p>

<p>If you are willing to hear how we do web services
and how we integrated an <strong>API-first</strong> approach then
don&rsquo;t miss the opportunity to rate his talks, as I&rsquo;m
sure he&rsquo;d be happy to showcase our best practices and
hear your feedbacks and suggestions, to make Namshi&rsquo;s
SOA even sharper; along with these topics he&rsquo;ll be
happy to talk about some of the other tools and systems
we use like Redis and RabbitMQ.</p>

<p>But even more important, <a href="http://confoo.ca/en/register">grab your ticket</a> for the
event as I can ensure you it&rsquo;s one of a kind and you won&rsquo;t
regret it!</p>
